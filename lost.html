						<h5><strong>Coaches/Mentors
</strong></h5>
<p>Our resources can provide you great help during the build season with strategizing, organizing, and practicing. Here are some of the resources you may want to check out:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="calculator.html">Standard Calculator</a> </strong>The calculator will provide you with a good starting point for learning the value of each mission. Encourage your students to play around with it to decide which missions they think would make the most effective strategy.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="printable.html">Printable Score Sheet</a> </strong>This printable sheet is designed for when you don't have internet access. You can use it in conjunction with the calculator to see a match score after a practice run.</h6>
</li>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/c/quiz/261946">Game Test</a></strong> The game test is a great way to challenge your students to make sure they know all of the rules of the game. The teams who perform the best are the teams who know the game.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="practice.html">Practice Scoring System</a></strong> This is an all in one type of system where you can have a "referee" use a phone/tablet (computers are okay, too) to enter a score into the system. This is ideal for practice matches as you get close to events. It also can give your drivers something to except at a competition as they will review the score with the referee. At the end, you will be emailed a detailed scoring report which you can go over with your students to see where improvement is needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Students
</strong></h5>
<p>Our resources can take out a lot of the mundane work of calculating scores and practicing for students. Some resources to check out are listed here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="calculator.html">Standard Calculator</a> </strong>With the release of the challenge, you may want a place to start so that you know which missions to attack first based on point value. This eliminates the need for looking up points in the rules and helps with more complex "if this...then that..." type of rules.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="printable.html">Printable Score Sheet</a> </strong>This printable sheet is designed for when you don't have internet access. You can use it in conjunction with the calculator to see a match score after a practice run.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p><a href="https://www.qzzr.com/c/quiz/261946"><strong>Game Test</strong></a> Think you've mastered the game? Take this test to see if you've got it down or need to read the rules through again. Challenge your friends and see who does the best! Remember, teams that know the rules always perform better than those who do not.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p><strong><a href="practice.html">Practice Scoring System</a></strong> This system lets you simulate a competition. Student drivers can have a full practice run as if they are at the competition and then go over the points with the referee. This also allows you to take a close look at which missions you need to work on more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Tournament Directors and Operational Partners
</strong></h5>
